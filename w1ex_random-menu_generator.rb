Requirements:
    Reinforce creating, using, and manipulating strings
    Reinforce setting and accessing variables
    Reinforce creating arrays
    Reinforce accessing element(s) from an array

Optional Enhancements:
    Expand your solution to ensure that no descriptive term in a menu item is ever repeated.
       So if the first menu item is hot pan-fried dumplings, the the phrases hot,
       pan-friend and dumpling cannot individually be used in any other menu items
    Expand your solution to allow the user to determine how many items they'd like to see via user input
        Note: You will need to ensure that this user-chosen number of items
        is not larger than the number of items you have in your arrays.
    Instead of using hardcoded or predefined arrays, make your program accept user input.
        This user input will be utilized to generate the menu items.
        You'll need to prompt for and store a varying number of entries for each food-type array
